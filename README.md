# Matrix_and_Vector
Basic operation with Matrix and Vector, using head guard (.h) files and related sub-file (.cpp)

The Lab3_Improve.dev is the "project" file, ie the file used to merge all other files together. Experience shows that downloading everything together is much safer and effective.

The program will initiate two (2) vectors and two (2) matrices. These are "starting" points, with size input from the user. There will be the following calcualtion
- Adding and substracting vectors (1 new vector each time)
- Adding and substracting matrices (1 new matrices each time)
- Scalar multiplication (factor input from user)
- Norm of a vector, with value p in put from user (speaking of this, I don't think I've seen this in my Math class...)
- Dot product
- Cross product
- Matrix multiplied with a vector
- Transpose

Note that all vectors and matrices will be allocated random values (with limit input by user) before doing everything
